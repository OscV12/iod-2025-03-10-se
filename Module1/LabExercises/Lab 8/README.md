//User Functionality\\

1. Select Dice Type
   The user should be able to select the type of dice they want to roll from a dropdown menu.
2. Roll the Dice
   The user should be able to click a button to roll the selected dice and get a random outcome.
   The button should be labeled "Roll Dice".
   When clicked, the result of the roll should appear below the button.
3. View Roll Outcome
   The user should be able to see the result of the dice roll on the page after clicking the button.
   The result should display a random number between 1 and the number of faces on the selected dice.
   The result should be displayed in a clear, readable format.
4. Reuse Roll Dice Functionality
   As a developer, I want to create a reusable rollDice function that can take the number of sides of the dice as an argument.
   The rollDice function should accept a parameter for the number of sides of the dice and return a random value between 1 and that number.
   The function should be invoked whenever the user clicks the "Roll Dice" button.

//Storyboard of a User Using the System\\

Alex and his friends are sitting around a table, excited to play a board game. They have everything ready to go, the game board, cards, and
tokens are all set up, but Alex realizes that their set of dice are missing. He looks in the box, and checks around the room, but they are nowhere to be found. Alex pulls out his phone and a few taps later finds a dice roll app that lets him choose any type of die that he might need and allows him to roll multiple times.
